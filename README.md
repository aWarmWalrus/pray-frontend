# Pray - Front End

## Getting started
Until we can upload the app to the Chrome Web store, you will have to load this
front end into Chrome as an extension in developer mode.

To do that, you need to

1. Download the repository `git clone https://github.com/aWarmWalrus/pray-frontend`
2. Open up the Chrome
3. Go to: `chrome://extensions` in the omnibar
4. In the top right corner, make sure "Developer mode" is checked
5. Click "Load unpacked extension..."
6. Find the folder where you cloned `pray-frontend` to and click `pray-frontend`
7. Try to see if it works! `Ctrl + t` away!
